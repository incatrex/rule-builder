Consolidate the Rule Metadata and Rule Structure Panels into a single panel that is fixed at the top when you scroll the Rule Definition:

Want this panel to be as short as possible to conserve space but still look nice:

1st row:  Rule ID, Version, Load Rule button, Save Rule button
2nd row:  Description
3rd row:  Structure, Return Type, Rule Type


Rule Type:  Dropdown from a static list in backend - ruleTypes.json

populate this for now with these values:

Reporting
Transformation
Aggregation
Validation
